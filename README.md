# Code and Erratum for *On the asymptotic category*

I collected a bit of Magma code relevant for the paper *On the asymptotic category*
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03044">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03044</a> on this page.

The code is in a **.odt** file or **.n** file, respectively, that can be downloaded from this site and you can run it with Magma.

An Erratum for the paper *On the asymptotic category* can be found at the bottom of the page.

# Background

The paper *On the asymptotic category* identifies the asymtotic (Hecke) category $\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{H}}$ for diagonal H-cells $\mathcal{H}$ and all finite Coxeter types with few exceptions. 
Let us go through the cases, with reference to the list of irreducible finite Coxeter groups as e.g. here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group#Classification">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group#Classification</a>.

- First, if the Coxeter type is classical (types A,B,C,D), then $\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{H}}$ is a well-known and uncomplicated fusion category, namely the category $\mathbf{Vec}(G)$ of vector spaces graded by an elementary abelian 2-group $G$.

- In all other types we list in the paper what we expect the asymtotic category to be, and also when we were able to verify that it is what it is.

The idea is that one can identify $\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{H}}$ by computing cateogrical dimensions, and the program below can do that using Magma.
